      "A woman who says she is “Victim-1” in the New York indictment against deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein filed suit against the executors of his estate Wednesday, saying he abused her for three years beginning when she was a 14-year-old girl struggling to find a way to help her family pay rent.\n",
      "The suit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, offers new details about Epstein’s interactions with Victim-1, including specifics of the alleged crimes, and how her personal situation made her an easier target. The lawsuit was filed by the woman’s lawyer, Roberta A. Kaplan.\n",
      "[Read the complaint: Jane Doe v. Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, in their capacities as the executors of the estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein]\n",
      "In court papers identifying her as “Jane Doe,” she alleges Epstein recruited her to engage in sex acts in 2002, at a time when she was “in serious financial straits.”\n",
      "Her sister was sick, and the family had so little money that the girl was forced to move out, staying with “a rotating cast of friends and took odd jobs after school to try to help her family pay rent,” according to the suit.\n",
      "Around that time, an older girl brought her to Epstein’s mansion on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, where he would pay her hundreds of dollars for massages that gradually escalated into sex acts with Epstein and others, according to the suit.\n",
      "The abuse continued until she was 17, and she was sexually assaulted “countless times” in those three years, the lawsuit charges.\n",
      "[Judge drops Epstein charges after his death]\n",
      "She also alleges that she was sexually assaulted by another Epstein employee. The lawsuit says she was brought into a bedroom with an adult woman she did not know and that, together, they engaged in sex acts with Epstein. The lawsuit also asserts that Victim-1 was frequently paid for her time with Epstein by two of his assistants.\n",
      "Prosecutors have said they continue to investigate whether anyone connected to Epstein should be charged as co-conspirators. His accusers have focused, in particular, on Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s longtime associate, and other members of his staff.\n",
      "[Epstein’s accusers call her his protector and procurer. Is Ghislaine Maxwell now prosecutors’ target?]\n",
      "The woman identified as Victim-1 still suffers from “severe mental anguish because of Epstein’s abuse,” the lawsuit said, noting she never finished high school, and her “physical and emotional injuries impact her daily functioning, making it difficult to go to work and take care of her young daughter and her ailing mother.”\n",
      "The suit was filed against Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, Epstein’s longtime lawyers who were named in his will as executors of his estate. A number of other alleged victims of Epstein’s abuse are suing or plan to sue Epstein’s estate, which is valued at more than $577 million.\n",
      "The lawsuit filed Wednesday does not specify how much money Victim-1 is seeking in damages.\n",
      "[At least 8 jail officials knew Epstein was not to be left alone in his cell]\n",
      "Epstein, 66, was arrested in July when he arrived in New Jersey on a private jet. The sex trafficking charges filed against him were similar to ones in Florida that had been settled with a plea deal in 2008 that has since been criticized as alarmingly lenient. Prosecutors say Epstein recruited dozens of teenage girls to come to his homes and give him massages that frequently escalated to sex acts. He paid the girls hundreds of dollars for each visit, his victims have said.\n",
      "About a month after his arrest, Epstein was found dead in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Lower Manhattan. The charges he was facing carried a potential prison sentence of up to 45 years, and the city’s medical examiner has ruled his death a suicide, saying he hanged himself. Epstein’s lawyers have not accepted that finding, saying they are conducting their own investigation. Before he died, Epstein had pleaded not guilty to the sex trafficking charges.\n",
      "The FBI and Justice Department are investigating the circumstances of his death to see if there were any crimes committed as part of the Bureau of Prisons’ failures to keep Epstein alive while he was awaiting trial.\n",

    "#raw_text = 'Those Who Are Resilient Stay In The Game Longer\\n“On the mountains of truth you can never climb in vain: either you will reach a point higher up today, or you will be training your powers so that you will be able to climb higher tomorrow.” — Friedrich Nietzsche\\nChallenges and setbacks are not meant to defeat you, but promote you. However, I realise after many years of defeats, it can crush your spirit and it is easier to give up than risk further setbacks and disappointments. Have you experienced this before? To be honest, I don’t have the answers. I can’t tell you what the right course of action is; only you will know. However, it’s important not to be discouraged by failure when pursuing a goal or a dream, since failure itself means different things to different people. To a person with a Fixed Mindset failure is a blow to their self-esteem, yet to a person with a Growth Mindset, it’s an opportunity to improve and find new ways to overcome their obstacles. Same failure, yet different responses. Who is right and who is wrong? Neither. Each person has a different mindset that decides their outcome. Those who are resilient stay in the game longer and draw on their inner means to succeed.\\nI’ve coached many clients who gave up after many years toiling away at their respective goal or dream. It was at that point their biggest breakthrough came. Perhaps all those years of perseverance finally paid off. It was the 19th Century’s minister Henry Ward Beecher who once said: “One’s best success comes after their greatest disappointments.” No one knows what the future holds, so your only guide is whether you can endure repeated defeats and disappointments and still pursue your dream. Consider the advice from the American academic and psychologist Angela Duckworth who writes in Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance: “Many of us, it seems, quit what we start far too early and far too often. Even more than the effort a gritty person puts in on a single day, what matters is that they wake up the next day, and the next, ready to get on that treadmill and keep going.”\\nI know one thing for certain: don’t settle for less than what you’re capable of, but strive for something bigger. Some of you reading this might identify with this message because it resonates with you on a deeper level. For others, at the end of their tether the message might be nothing more than a trivial pep talk. What I wish to convey irrespective of where you are in your journey is: NEVER settle for less. If you settle for less, you will receive less than you deserve and convince yourself you are justified to receive it.\\n“Two people on a precipice over Yosemite Valley” by Nathan Shipps on Unsplash\\nDevelop A Powerful Vision Of What You Want\\n“Your problem is to bridge the gap which exists between where you are now and the goal you intend to reach.” — Earl Nightingale\\nI recall a passage my father often used growing up in 1990s: “Don’t tell me your problems unless you’ve spent weeks trying to solve them yourself.” That advice has echoed in my mind for decades and became my motivator. Don’t leave it to other people or outside circumstances to motivate you because you will be let down every time. It must come from within you. Gnaw away at your problems until you solve them or find a solution. Problems are not stop signs, they are advising you that more work is required to overcome them. Most times, problems help you gain a skill or develop the resources to succeed later. So embrace your challenges and develop the grit to push past them instead of retreat in resignation. Where are you settling in your life right now? Could you be you playing for bigger stakes than you are? Are you willing to play bigger even if it means repeated failures and setbacks? You should ask yourself these questions to decide whether you’re willing to put yourself on the line or settle for less. And that’s fine if you’re content to receive less, as long as you’re not regretful later.If you have not achieved the success you deserve and are considering giving up, will you regret it in a few years or decades from now? Only you can answer that, but you should carve out time to discover your motivation for pursuing your goals. It’s a fact, if you don’t know what you want you’ll get what life hands you and it may not be in your best interest, affirms author Larry Weidel: “Winners know that if you don’t figure out what you want, you’ll get whatever life hands you.” The key is to develop a powerful vision of what you want and hold that image in your mind. Nurture it daily and give it life by taking purposeful action towards it.\\nVision + desire + dedication + patience + daily action leads to astonishing success. Are you willing to commit to this way of life or jump ship at the first sign of failure? I’m amused when I read questions written by millennials on Quora who ask how they can become rich and famous or the next Elon Musk. Success is a fickle and long game with highs and lows. Similarly, there are no assurances even if you’re an overnight sensation, to sustain it for long, particularly if you don’t have the mental and emotional means to endure it. This means you must rely on the one true constant in your favour: your personal development. The more you grow, the more you gain in terms of financial resources, status, success — simple. If you leave it to outside conditions to dictate your circumstances, you are rolling the dice on your future.So become intentional on what you want out of life. Commit to it. Nurture your dreams. Focus on your development and if you want to give up, know what’s involved before you take the plunge. Because I assure you, someone out there right now is working harder than you, reading more books, sleeping less and sacrificing all they have to realise their dreams and it may contest with yours. Don’t leave your dreams to chance.'"
